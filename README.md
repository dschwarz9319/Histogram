# Histogram
## General
This program uses a simulation technique called the "Inverse Transformative Method" to generate a random sample set based off another sample set where they both have the same average. The program then tests this using the Chi-Goodness of Fit Test.
### Graph
The program displays a bar graph of both the original set of data as well as the randomized replica to better help the user interpret the data.
